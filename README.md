# dailycybernews

Daily Cyber News will be a news aggergator that automatically curates cybersecurity news and displays them for the user each day. This site will help researchers and scholars find their cybersecurity news faster and get stuff done. Our website will be open source and will allow pull requests for other cybersecurity blogs/websites to be added to the aggregator.  

This distro will be relatively dormant until we decide what framework will be used for our backend. You can expect a major pull-request at this time. There is no estimated time at this moment.
